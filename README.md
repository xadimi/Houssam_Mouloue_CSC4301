# Houssam_Mouloue_CSC4301

I present a project about pathfinding using different search strategies (DFS, BFS, UCS â€“ assume same cost in all directions- and A* with different heuristics. I had the help of Sebastian Lague with his youtube videos and his GitHub repository: (https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding). I displayed the different algorithms path with different colours and their total output time. 

PS: I couldn't find a way to display the memmory usage.
